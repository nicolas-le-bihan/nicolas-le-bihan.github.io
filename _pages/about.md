I am currently a senior research fellow with the <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr">CNRS</a> at <a href="http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/">Gipsa-lab</a> in Grenoble, France. Since 2020, I am in the <a href="https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/pole/gaia">GAIA</a> team at Gipsa-Lab.

From 2013 to 2015, I was a visiting research fellow at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research in Melbourne was supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (IOF) from the European Union and the CNRS.

My research interests include: bivariate signal processing, statistics on groups and manifolds, polarized time series analysis and their application in gravitational wave astronomy.
