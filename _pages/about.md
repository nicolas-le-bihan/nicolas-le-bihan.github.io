<p style="font-family: 'Courier Prime';font-size: 14px"> "Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention", R.P. Feynman.</p>

I am currently a senior research fellow with the <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr">CNRS</a> at <a href="http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/">Gipsa-lab</a> in Grenoble, France. Since 2020, I am in the <a href="https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/pole/gaia">GAIA</a> team at Gipsa-Lab.

From 2013 to 2015, I was a visiting research fellow at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research in Melbourne was supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (IOF) from the European Union and the CNRS.

My research interests include: bivariate signal processing, statistics on groups and manifolds, polarized time series analysis and their application in gravitational wave astronomy.

## open position
We have a __Ph.D. position available__, with starting date on 01/10/2025, co-supervised by E. Chassande-Mottin (APC, Paris) on "Geometric approach in bivariate signal processing for the analysis of gravitational wave polarization". __For any information, please send me an [email](mailto:nicolas.le-bihan@cnrs.fr)__

Applications should be sent directly through the CNRS [website](https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/Doctorant/UMR5216-CHRROM-034/Default.aspx).
