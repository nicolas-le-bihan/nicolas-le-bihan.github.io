From 2013 to 2015, I was a visiting research fellow at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research in Melbourne was supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (IOF) from the European Union and the CNRS.

My research interests include: bivariate signal processing, statistics on groups and manifolds, polarized time series analysis and their application in gravitational wave astronomy.


[//]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
